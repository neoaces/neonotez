# Anzle Chavez - neonotes

Hey! I'm a high school student based in Toronto that is currently studying systems and backend programming through Rust. This blog is dedicated to the journey into rediscovering 1's and 0's through projects I wished to develop for a long time.

Many of the blog posts pertain to programming and computer science, but there are also hidden gems from various art and scientific endeavours.

Safe travels, explorer. [See all of my posts here.](/posts)
